  <h2>How to Calculate Simple Interest</h2>

  <p>
    The formula used to calculate simple interest is:
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Simple Interest = (Principal × Rate × Time) / 100</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    This calculator uses the same formula to instantly calculate the interest amount based on the values you enter.
  </p>

  <h2>Example of Simple Interest Calculation</h2>

  <p>
    If the principal amount is ₹10,000, the rate of interest is 5% per year, and the time period is 2 years, then:
  </p>

  <p>
    Simple Interest = (10,000 × 5 × 2) / 100 = ₹1,000
  </p>

  <h2>Who Should Use This Calculator</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Students learning basic interest calculations</li>
    <li>People calculating simple loan interest</li>
    <li>Anyone needing quick and easy interest calculations</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Difference Between Simple Interest and Compound Interest</h2>

  <p>
    Simple interest is calculated only on the principal amount, while compound interest is calculated on both the principal and the accumulated interest.
